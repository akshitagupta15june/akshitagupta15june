I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and an XR open-source fellow at Z-Anatomy. My focus is on developing 3D gaming applications using Unity 3D for Z-Anatomy in the extended reality domain. I have exceptional teamwork skills and am constantly looking to add value to any project I undertake.

### XROS'23 Fellow

My work at [Z-Anatomy](https://www.z-anatomy.com/) is supported by the [XROS Fellowship](https://xrosfellowship.ficci.in/), which is sponsored by Meta (Facebook) and FICCI and initiated by Reskill. This fellowship provides me with the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects and explore my creativity while gaining valuable industry experience.

I possess a strong aptitude for leadership roles and have successfully completed numerous projects as part of a team or as a leader. My proficiency is evident from my experience in various hackathons, where I have won over 50 technical and business hackathons, including highly esteemed international events such as "MIT Grand Hacks" and "MIT Hacking Racism."
